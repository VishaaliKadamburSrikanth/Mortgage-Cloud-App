3. Postman – Postman is a desktop tool/client that is used to test APIs. It provides all the necessary options to send an API request from the client. By doing, we'll able to identify any issues in the web services without having to build a client. I've used this to test my REST API Endpoints.

4. Docker – Docker is a tool that is used to containerize the applications. Containerization is a way of running the application in an isolated virtual environment. Docker facilitates this by packing the application code and its dependency as a single unit called image. Multiple containers can be created from this image.

5. Azure-cli – It is a command line interface provided by Microsoft Azure to facilitate the deployment from terminal. I’ve used specified commands in that to deploy the web app to cloud environment.
